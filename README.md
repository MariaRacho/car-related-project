Project Idea (Scenario)
System Title: SmartCar Workshop Booking System

This project is about developing a digital system for managing bookings and service records at a car workshop. Customers should be able to book service appointments online, while the workshop staff can manage bookings, view car histories, and send reminders.

Background and Purpose
Many car workshops still rely on phone calls and paper calendars, which can lead to missed appointments, double bookings, and inefficient workflows. A modern, digital solution improves the customer experience and streamlines the workshop's daily operations.

This project is important because:
1. It saves time for both customers and staff.
2. It reduces human error.
3. It can be reused or adapted for other service-based businesses.

Vision & Goals
Vision / Problem Statement
To create an intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly online booking system for a car workshop that handles appointments, customer data, car service records, and notifications.

Goals
By the end of this project, the system should allow:
1. Customers to register, log in, and book service times.
2. Mechanics/admins to manage and view bookings.
3. The system to send reminders before appointments.

Success metrics:
1. Functional prototype with all core features.
2. Usability: Easy to use with minimal training.
3. All core features tested and working.

Functional Requirements
1. Users can register and log in securely.
2. Customers can book a service appointment.
3. Customers can see available time slots.
4. Admins can approve or cancel bookings.
5. System stores and displays car service history.
6. System sends reminders via email/SMS.
7. Users can cancel or reschedule a booking.

Non-Functional Requirements
1. The system must encrypt passwords and secure all login data to protect user privacy.
2. The user interface must be easy to use and intuitive for both customers and staff.
3. The system must load pages and complete actions (e.g., booking) within 2 seconds.
4. The system must be available and stable during working hours (e.g., 08:00â€“18:00).
5. The system must work well on both desktop and mobile devices using responsive design.
